                        to request companionship from trusted volunteers to acompany them on their route. A user simply signs into their account and adds some basic information about their route. Once 
                        is in the system, volunteers in your vacinity will be able to accept the request.

                    <p className="info-para" >If you or someone you know would like a trusted volunteer to join you on your next outing please sign up today! Whether it's an everyday errand, grocery trip, 
                        or just a walk in the park, our volunteers are ready escort you with a smile. Once your trip is completed please, don't forget to "upcookie" or "downcookie" 
                        your companion. Your feedback is vital to assuring all TagAlong volunteers provide a comfortable eviroment for all.
